# Given an array of intervals, find the next interval of each interval.
# In a list of intervals, for an interval ‘i’ its next interval ‘j’ will
# have the smallest ‘start’ greater than or equal to the ‘end’ of ‘i’.

# Write a function to return an array containing indices of the next interval
# of each input interval. If there is no next interval of a given interval,
# return -1. It is given that none of the intervals have the same start point.
