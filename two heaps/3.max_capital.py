# Given a set of investment projects with their respective profits, we need
# to find the most profitable projects. We are given an initial capital and
# are allowed to invest only in a fixed number of projects. Our goal is to
# choose projects that give us the maximum profit.

# We can start an investment project only when we have the required capital.
# Once a project is selected, we can assume that its profit has become
# our capital.
