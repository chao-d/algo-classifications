# Design a class to calculate the median of a number stream. The class
# should have the following two methods:

# insertNum(int num): stores the number in the class
# findMedian(): returns the median of all numbers inserted in the class
# If the count of numbers inserted in the class is even, the median will
# be the average of the middle two numbers.


class MedianOfAStream:
    def insert_num(self, num):
        # TODO: Write your code here
        return -1

    def find_median(self):
        # TODO: Write your code here
        return 0.0
